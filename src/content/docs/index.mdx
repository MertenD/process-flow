This document serves as the introduction and overview of a Process Aware Information System (PAIS) that integrates gamification to enhance user engagement and streamline process management.

The system provides a platform that combines an editor for modeling business processes with BPMN 2.0 with an execution engine that runs these processes in real-time. Monitoring tools offer insights into process performance and user activity, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with business objectives.

Accounts within the system enable long-term tracking of rewards, potentially integrating with a shop for redeeming points. They also allow for user-specific Worklists, which hold the active tasks a user should complete.

The monitoring section provides a snapshot of functionality and user interaction with the system, offering a real-world reflection of processes and their effectiveness.
