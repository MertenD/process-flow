## User Management Section
This section manages user-related information, including roles and team structures, which define access levels and collaboration.

## Process Modeling Section
At the heart of the schema is the Process Modeling section, where the blueprint of the process is defined with elements like events, activities, gateways, and sequence flows.

## Process Instances Section
The Process Instances section focuses on the real-time operation of process models, handling instances of data objects and flow elements.

## Gamification Section
The Gamification section brings in elements of game design to engage users, tracking statistics for implementing features such as leaderboards and rewards.

Interconnectivity between sections ensures the system remains coherent while catering to the structured requirements of process management and the engaging aspects of gamification.
